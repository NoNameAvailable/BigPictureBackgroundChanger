BigPictureBackgroundChanger
===========================

The code is currently very rough, and is just an upload of my NetBeans folder. This currently needs a lot of work, and is in no good position for daily use.

How Rough is Rough?
===================

Really, Really, Rough. It works, but the code is currently badly documented, and has snippets from many different ideas for various ways to change the background. It may be somewhat usable, but it is full of problems, and not yet ready for prime time. If you would like to help however, go on ahead as I need all the help I can get.

What is it?
===========
A Java application designed to change the blue background that comes in Big Picture mode to one of the users choosing. In the future eventually, I hope to expand it to becoming a Program allowing you to apply your own themes to Big Picture Mode, however for now it just changes the background.

What Platforms does it support?
===============================
Currently, it only works in Windows, however I'm planning on expanding it to Linux, so that I could support SteamOS mainly.
