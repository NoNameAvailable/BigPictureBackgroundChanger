BigPictureBackgroundChanger
===========================

The code is currently very rough, and is just an upload of my NetBeans folder. This currently needs a lot of work, and is in no good position for daily use.


What is it?
===========
A Java application designed to change the blue background that comes in Big Picture mode to one of the users choosing.

What Platforms does it support?
===============================
Currently, it only works in windows, however I'm planning on expanding it to linux, so that I could support SteamOS mainly.
